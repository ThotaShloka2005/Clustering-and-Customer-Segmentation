This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment paper product customers based on their purchasing patterns and preferences.

🎯 Objectives
Cluster customers based on behavioral data.

Identify distinct segments for targeted marketing.

Analyze preferences and patterns within each segment.

Generate strategic recommendations for personalized marketing.

📚 Learning Outcomes
✅ Apply K-means clustering and other algorithms
✅ Interpret and visualize customer segments
✅ Translate data insights into marketing strategies

💾 Dataset
The dataset contains customer transaction and attribute data, with fields such as:

CustomerID: Unique identifier

Annual_Spend: Yearly expenditure on paper products

Visit_Frequency: Average monthly store visits

Discount_Usage: Proportion of purchases using discounts

Satisfaction_Score: Self-reported satisfaction (1-10)

Replace customer_data.csv with your actual file.

🔧 Getting Started
1️⃣ Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
2️⃣ Load the dataset:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')
print(df.head())
3️⃣ Run the clustering notebook to:

Preprocess data

Apply K-means and other clustering algorithms

Visualize clusters

📈 Expected Outputs
📊 Visual plots of customer clusters

🏷️ Cluster profiles (average spend, satisfaction, etc.)

💡 Segment-specific marketing strategies

🔍 Further Exploration
Try hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN for different insights.

Explore dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for better visualization.
